# git_readme_builder
Good README Builder App


This app will help generate a README.md file for a project by asking some preliminary questions about the project to the user of the app.

After providing the basic information to prepare the basic structure of the README.md file, this app will generate a README.md template with common README topics pre-formatted and ready to be edited or tailored to the user's preferences.
