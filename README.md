# git_readme_builder
Git README Builder App

This app will help generate a README.md file for a project by asking some preliminary questions about the project to the user of the app.

This app can be run from the command-line.  The application will be invoked with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```

After providing the basic information to prepare the basic structure of the README.md file, this app will generate a README.md template with common README topics pre-formatted and ready to be edited or tailored to the user's preferences.

The README will be populated with the following:

* At least one badge
* Project title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions
  * User GitHub profile picture
  * User GitHub email
